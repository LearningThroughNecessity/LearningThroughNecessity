- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LearningThroughNecessity
- 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mainly Raspberry Pi projects. I have set up this Github as a backup for a bunch of notepad documents that I have pulled together to make projects work.
- 
- ðŸ“« I can't offer any support for anyone following these guides. I have made these from much patience and trial/error and mashing together bits from tutorials. I will do what I can to provide links and learning resources where I can.
